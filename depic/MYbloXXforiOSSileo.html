What makes MYbloXX for iOS better than the alternatives you ask?\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell: FASTER browsing, BETTER battery life AND AUTO-UPDATING! But how?\r\n\r\nThe problem with alternate ad-blocking tweaks is that they rely on hosts file modifications to block ads... Not only is this static, requiring constant manual additions to the file and pushes of package updates (rarely done) but it also takes a toll on your download/upload speed... The more rules in the hosts file, the longer it takes to load pages/download information. This method also requires additional tweaks (LetMeBlock) to allow mDNSresponder\u2019s use of the hosts file. This is also a strain on system daemons which causes a significant amount of battery drain, especially if mDNSresponder goes haywire, which it\u2019s known to do.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s where MYbloXX for iOS comes in!\r\n\r\nSecurity is a top priority for everyone... MYbloXX for iOS ensures that remains top of the list. That's why we don't use third-party Proxy servers, for example, ffapple... Who knows who is looking at all of your traffic when using those?! And then there's the third-party DNS apps like DNSCloak where your traffic is again, routed through a third-party (DNS) server. MYbloXX for iOS is different: All traffic is blocked ON DEVICE. Your traffic is NEVER routed through any third-party proxy/DNS servers - To see exactly how this works, the script is available in plain text here: https://MYXXdev.github.io/MYbloXXforiOS.pac\r\n\r\nMYbloXX for iOS is a simple configuration profile that uses JavaScript to check against specified rules within a PAC file. If the domain requested is within the PAC's list, it will route to a blackhole. The PAC configuration uses wildcards to more efficiently block targeted ad-servers and known domain structures like http://ad._____\r\n\r\nThe use of wildcards means we can remove a vast majority of entries within the hosts file to ensure a fast, efficient ad-blocking method.\r\n\r\nMYbloXX for iOS uses a powerful Apple stock feature that is usually only available to those with \"supervised\" devices. It also allows for on-the-fly updates to quickly add new ad-servers and works on all versions of iOS, all carriers and ISP\u2019s (IPv4 and IPv6 respectively...\r\n\r\nMYbloXX for iOS aims to block as many ads as possible out of the box using a technique that has not been used in any other ad-blocking tweaks until now. With new ad servers being created on a daily basis, on rare occasions, it\u2019s possible you\u2019ll come across an ad in an app/on a website.\r\n\r\nIf this happens, please use the MYbloXX app to submit a report or the official MYXXdev Telegram Group: https://t.me/MYXXdev\u2026 The more that use this feature, the better!\r\n\r\nAd-servers that are added to MYbloXX for iOS will be updated AUTOMATICALLY on your device providing up to the minute protection from ads, revokes, trackers, miners and all other malicious content/threats.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n* Works for WiFi and data (5G/LTE/4G/3G) connections.\r\n* Does not rely on hosts/other tweaks to work.\r\n* Works in stock AND jailbroken mode.\r\n* Works alongside VPN servers/apps.\r\n* Blocks all language ad-servers.\r\n* Works for all versions of iOS.\r\n* No filesystem modifications.\r\n* Blocks pop-ups/Redirects.* Blocks Facebook video ads.\r\n* Blocks user stats scripts.\r\n* IPv4/IPv6 compatibility.\r\n* Blocks app revocations.\r\n* Blocks in-game ads.\r\n* Blocks tweak ads.\r\n* No battery drain.\r\n* Auto-updates.\r\n\r\nThis profile requires your iDevice be managed/supervised.\r\nThis is a restriction set in place by Apple on a system level due to the nature of the profile.\r\n\r\nJAILBROKEN users: This package will spoof your devices \u201cisSupervised\u201d status allowing easy installation. On removal of this package, your device will return to its true unsupervised state. While installed, to remove the \u201cThis iPhone is supervised and managed.\u201d message in Settings, please install \u201cisSupervisedBeGone\u201d after installation.\r\n\r\nSTOCK users: MYbloXX for iOS requires you supervise/manage your device using Apple Configurator 2 (Mac only) prior to installation.\r\n\r\nThis requires restoring your device in order to configure/supervise so please ensure to BACKUP YOUR DEVICE prior to supervising/managing with Apple Configurator 2.\r\n\r\nYou can manually remove this profile/package at any time using your choice of package manager (Cydia etc.) to uninstall MYbloXX for iOS as well as/or navigating to Settings - General - Profiles & Device Management.\r\n\r\nA special thanks to Droom0ne, yoyo and all beta testers for their contributions!\r\n\r\nPowered by MYXX FM - #1 for Spanglish Hits!\r\nMYXXfm.com",
