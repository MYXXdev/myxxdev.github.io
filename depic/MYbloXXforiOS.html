    So... What makes MYbloXX for iOS better than the alternatives you ask?
                                    <br><br>
    In a nutshell: FASTER browsing, BETTER battery life AND AUTO-UPDATING! But how?
<br>
    <br>
    The problem with alternate ad-blocking tweaks is that they rely on hosts file modifications to block ads... Not only is this static, requiring constant manual additions to the file and pushes of package updates (rarely done) but it also takes a toll on your download/upload speed... The more rules in the hosts file, the longer it takes to load pages/download information. This method also requires additional tweaks (LetMeBlock) to allow mDNSresponder’s use of the hosts file. This is also a strain on system daemons which causes a significant amount of battery drain, especially if mDNSresponder goes haywire, which it’s known to do.
 <br>
    <br>
    That’s where MYbloXX for iOS comes in!
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Security is a top priority for everyone... MYbloXX for iOS ensures that remains top of the list. That's why we don't use third-party Proxy servers, for example, ffapple... Who knows who is looking at all of your traffic when using those?! And then there's the third-party DNS apps like DNSCloak where your traffic is again, routed through a third-party (DNS) server. MYbloXX for iOS is different: All traffic is blocked ON DEVICE. Your traffic is NEVER routed through any third-party proxy/DNS servers - To see exactly how this works, the script is available in plain text here: https://MYXXdev.github.io/MYbloXXforiOS.pac

                                MYbloXX for iOS is a simple configuration profile that uses JavaScript to check against specified rules within a PAC file. If the domain requested is within the PAC's list, it will route to a blackhole. The PAC congifuration uses wildcards to more effeciently block targeted ad-servers and known domain structures like http://ad._____
                                    <br><br>The use of wildcards means we can remove a vast majority of entries within the hosts file to ensure a fast, efficient ad-blocking method.
                                    <br><br>MYbloXX uses a powerful Apple stock feature that is usually only available to those with "supervised" devices. It also allows for on-the-fly updates to quickly add new ad-servers and works on all versions of iOS, all carriers and ISP’s (IPv4 and IPv6 respectively...
                                    <br><br>MYbloXX for iOS aims to block as many ads as possible out of the box using a technique that has not been used in any other ad-blocking tweaks until now. With new ad servers being created on a daily basis, on rare occasions, it’s possible you’ll come across an ad in an app/on a website.<br><br> If this happens, please use the MYbloXX app to submit a report or the official MYXXdev Telegram Group: https://t.me/MYXXdev… The more that use this feature, the better!
<br><br>Ad-servers that are added to MYbloXX for iOS will be updated AUTOMATICALLY on your device providing up to the minute protection from ads, revokes, trackers, miners and all other malicious content/threats.
